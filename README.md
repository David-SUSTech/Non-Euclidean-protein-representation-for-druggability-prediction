# Non-Euclidean-protein-representation-for-druggability-prediction
Here we provide the original data, including druggable and non-druggable proteins' pdb ids, each protein's secondary structure proportions and PTM site information.
The secondary structure data and PTM sites data are derived from Network Protein Sequence Analysis (NPS@) website.
